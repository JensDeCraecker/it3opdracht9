    <h3>The Weeknd ft. Daft Punk || 10</h3>
    <p>Evolving from French house pioneers in the '90s to 2000s tastemakers to mainstream successes in the 2010s, Daft Punk remained one of dance music's most influential and iconic acts. The combined talents of Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, the Parisian duo quickly won acclaim for their unique blend of first-wave acid house and techno with pop, indie rock, and hip-hop. One of the pair's first projects together was Darling, an instrumental indie cover band; their current recording name derives from a review in U.K. music weekly Melody Maker of a compilation tape Darling were featured on, released by Krautrock revivalists Stereolab (their lo-fi D.I.Y. cover of a Beach Boys song was derided as "daft punk"). Subsequently ditching the almost inevitable creative cul-de-sac of rock for the more appealing rush of the dancefloor, the pair released their debut single, "The New Wave," in 1993 on the celebrated Soma label. Instantly hailed by the dance music press as the work of a new breed of house innovators, the single was followed by "Da Funk," the band's first true hit (the record sold 30,000 copies worldwide and saw thorough rinsings by everyone from Kris Needs to the Chemical Brothers).
Although the group had only released a trio of singles ("The New Wave" and "Da Funk," as well as the 1996 limited pressing of "Musique"), in early 1996 Daft Punk were the subject of a minor bidding war. The group eventually signed with Virgin, with its first long-player, Homework, appearing early the following year (a brief preview of the album, "Musique," was also featured on the Virgin compilation Wipeout XL next to tracks from Photek, Future Sound of London, the Chemical Brothers, and Source Direct). As with the earlier singles, the group's sound is a brazen, dancefloor-oriented blend of progressive house, funk, electro, and techno, with sprinklings of hip-hop-styled breakbeats and excessive, crowd-firing samples similar to other anthemic dance-fusion acts such as the Chemical Brothers and Monkey Mafia. In addition to his role in Daft Punk, Bangalter operates the Roulé label and has recorded under his own name (the underground smash "Trax on da Rocks") as well as Stardust (the huge club/commercial hit "Music Sounds Better with You"). 
After four long years of fans eagerly awaiting a follow-up to their brilliant debut, Daft Punk finally issued Discovery in March 2001. The live record Alive 1997 followed at the end of the year, and a by-now predictable four-year wait preceded the release of Human After All in early 2005. One year later, Daft Punk released a compilation, Musique, Vol. 1: 1993-2005, and in 2007 their second live record, Alive 2007, arrived. The album and its single "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" won Grammy Awards early in 2009; shortly after, it was announced that the duo would compose the soundtrack to Tron: Legacy, the sequel to the 1982 classic sci-fi film Tron. Daft Punk's music for the movie was released in November 2010, shortly before the film -- which featured the group in a cameo -- arrived in theaters. 
Early in 2013, Daft Punk announced that they planned to have a new album released by May of that year. That March, the duo announced the album's title, Random Access Memories, and launched an extensive press campaign that featured snippets of the album's lead single, "Get Lucky," and interviews with some of their collaborators, who included Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams, Giorgio Moroder, and Panda Bear. The single was officially released in April, and Random Access Memories arrived in May. The album became one of Daft Punk's biggest successes, ultimately winning Grammy Awards for Best Dance/Electronica Album, Album of the Year, and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical; "Get Lucky" earned Grammys for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year. In 2014, the duo appeared on Pharrell's album G I R L and collaborated with Jay-Z on the song "Computerized." ~ Sean Cooper, Rovi</p>
    <h3>Machine Gun Kelly x Camila Cabello || 9</h3>
    <p>Every generation gets the bad boy/good girl story they deserve -- at least, according to Cleveland rapper Machine Gun Kelly. "There's something about America's sweetheart and America's bad boy," MGK tells Billboard about "Bad Things," his climbing hit with Fifth Harmony's Camila Cabello. "That juxtaposition is what everyone desires. Prior to this it was 'Bonnie and Clyde' from Jay and Beyoncé, going back further you have Romeo and Juliet." 

That description pretty much sums up the ear-wormy "Bad Things," the instantly catchy collabo that debuts at No. 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated Nov. 5 -- on sales of 26,000 during the week ending Oct. 20, according to Nielsen Music. "The first time I heard the song, I felt an instant connection to it," Cabello tells Billboard, describing how the "haunting" intro goes right into her angelic vocal. "To me it's sexy, but I didn't really think about it as being edgy and a step further, because it represents feelings about love that I related to."</p>
    <h3>The Weeknd || 8</h3>
    <p>Allegedly "shrouded in mystery" despite a social media presence (with accompanying photos) on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, SoundCloud, and YouTube, as well as major support from fellow Torontonian Drake, alternative R&B act the Weeknd -- a solo outlet for vocalist Abel Tesfaye -- surfaced in March 2011 with House of Balloons. A nine-track, 50-minute mixtape made available for free download on the Weeknd website, House of Balloons was based in morose ballads filled with drug references and sexual longing. Sonically, there were clear traces of radio-friendly contemporary R&B à la Trey Songz, Jeremih, the-Dream, and Drake, while also appealing to listeners who favored left-of-center, production-over-songcraft exponents like Spacek and Sa-Ra. The mixtape, made by Tesfaye in collaboration with producers Doc McKinney and Illangelo, among others, garnered widespread coverage -- most of which was gushingly positive -- within days of its March 21 release. A second mixtape, Thursday (August 19), preceded several appearances on Drake's album Take Care. Echoes of Silence (December 21), the third Weeknd mixtape, followed just before the end of the year. The following June, "Crew Love," off Take Care, reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. A few months later, he was featured on another charting single, Wiz Khalifa's "Remember You." 
After Tesfaye signed with Universal Republic, the three Weeknd mixtapes were remastered and bundled with three new songs for Trilogy, issued in November 2012. The set debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart. The following April, Tesfaye won Juno Awards in the categories of Breakthrough Artist of the Year and R&B/Soul Recording of the Year. Trilogy was certified platinum by the RIAA the next month. Kiss Land, much darker in tone than its title implied, followed in September 2013 and debuted at number two. Out of its several singles, only "Live For," featuring Drake, touched the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. Tesfaye had much more success with a series of non-album singles that followed. "Often," released in 2014, was a Top Ten R&B/Hip-Hop hit. He was featured on Ariana Grande's "Love Me Harder," which reached the Top Ten of the Hot 100 and went platinum in the U.S. "Earned It," featured in Fifty Shades of Grey, repeated the same feats. 
In 2015, Tesfaye issued "The Hills," a booming ballad, and "Can't Feel My Face," a disco-funk throwback, as the first two singles from Beauty Behind the Madness. Both songs topped the Hot 100. The album was issued that August and debuted at the same position. Through the end of 2015 and into 2016, he was featured on Disclosure's "In the Night," Kanye West's "FML," Future's "Low Life," and Beyoncé's "6 Inch," among other tracks. "Starboy," a collaboration with Daft Punk, was released in September 2016 as the lead single from Tesfaye's album of the same title. It became the singer's fifth Top Ten pop single prior to the November arrival of Starboy. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi</p>

    <h3>Amine - Caroline || 7</h3>
    <p>Adam Aminé Daniel (born April 18, 1994), professionally known as Aminé, is an American hip hop recording artist from Portland, Oregon. He released his debut single, "Caroline", which peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Extended family includes other noted public figures including Addey Kifle, KIPP Wisdom Academy Rookie of the Year 2015-2016.</p>
    <h3> Drake - Fake Love || 6</h3>
    <p>Drake was a cross-platform cultural phenomenon in the 2010s. The songwriter, producer, rapper, and singer sustained a high-level commercial presence shortly after he turned to rapping in 2006, whether on his own chart-topping releases or through a long string of guest appearances on hits by the likes of Lil Wayne, Rihanna, and A$AP Rocky. Each one of the former child actor's first four proper albums, as well as a 2015 mixtape, topped the album charts in his native Canada and in the U.S. Though he caroused with his most hedonistic contemporaries, Drake was frequently praised for his sensitive, introspective approach to rap and R&B.
Known initially for his role as Jimmy Brooks on Degrassi: The Next Generation, the Toronto, Ontario-born Aubrey Drake Graham stepped out as a rapper and singer with pop appeal in 2006, when he initiated a series of mixtapes. A year later, despite being unsigned, he scored major exposure when his cocky and laid-back track "Replacement Girl," featuring Trey Songz, was featured on BET's 106 & Park program as its "Joint of the Day." He raised his profile throughout the next several months by popping up on countless mixtapes and remixes, and as rumors swirled about contract offers from labels, he gradually became one of the most talked-about artists in the industry. It did not hurt that he had support from the likes of Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Lil Wayne. 
By the end of June 2009, "Best I Ever Had," a promotional single, had climbed to number two on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. After a fierce bidding war, Drake signed with Universal Motown in late summer and released an EP (So Far Gone) made up of songs from his popular So Far Gone mixtape. It peaked at number six on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and won a 2010 Juno Award for Rap Recording of the Year. Thank Me Later, a full-length featuring collaborations with the Kings of Leon, the-Dream, Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Lil Wayne, was issued through Young Money in June 2010. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Still, the artist felt his debut was rushed, so its follow-up arrived in November 2015 with the title Take Care, referencing the increased time and effort put into the album's creation. Receiving critical acclaim, Grammy Awards, and the number one slot on the U.S. Billboard 200, Take Care cemented Drake's place as one of Canada's biggest exports. 
In 2012, while on tour, Drake announced that he had started work on what would be his third studio album. Nothing Was the Same was released the following September. It spawned many singles, topped charts around the world, was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, and was nominated for a Best Rap Album Grammy. Soon after the album's release, he hit the road on an extended tour, took part in some collaborations, and released a few singles, including the Grammy-nominated "0 to 100/The Catch Up." His next release was planned as a free mixtape before Cash Money decided they would rather charge for it. The decidedly downbeat If You're Reading This It's Too Late was released in February 2015 and debuted at number one, while all 17 of its songs entered the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. 
In late summer 2015, he dropped a trio of new tracks on his Soundcloud page. One of them, the Timmy Thomas-sampling "Hotline Bling," became a Top Five pop hit in Canada and the U.S. and something of a cultural phenomenon. Later that year, Drake hit the studio with Future for a six-day session that yielded the mixtape What a Time to Be Alive. Upon the album's September release, it became Drake's second recording of the year to debut at number one. After dropping three singles in the beginning months of 2016, Drake's fourth album, Views, was released in April and debuted at number one. It revolved lyrically around his hometown Toronto and featured production by longtime cohorts Noah "40" Shebib and Boi-1da, among others. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi</p>
    <h3> D.R.A.M. Featuring Lil Yachty - Broccoli || 5</h3>
    <p>Rapper, singer, and producer D.R.A.M. (which stands for "Does. Real. Ass. Music.") is best known for his 2016 summer hit "Broccoli." Born Shelley Marshaun Massenburg-Smith in Germany, the Virginia-based artist released his debut mixtape, #1 Epic Summer, in 2014. It featured the single "Cha Cha," a club-worthy cut that was a regional hit. In 2015, he broke on a national scale when Cleveland R&B radio station Z 107.9 FM began playing the cut as their "weekend warmer," a campaign that eventually reached Beyoncé, who shared a video of her own version of the track. With Queen B's co-sign, "Cha Cha" was re-released that year while #1 Epic reappeared as an EP. Following the increased exposure brought on by "Cha Cha"'s success, D.R.A.M. released another mixtape, the aptly titled Gahdamn! in October 2015. Months later, he scored a hit with the Lil' Yachty-assisted "Broccoli." The track went gold and had risen into the Billboard Top 40 by the time summer rolled around in 2016. That October, D.R.A.M. issued his debut LP, Big Baby D.R.A.M. Debuting in the Top 20, the effort included "Broccoli," as well as guest appearances by Erykah Badu and Young Thug. ~ David Jeffries & Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi</p>

    <h3>Zay Hilfigerrr & Zayion McCall - Juju On That Beat (TZ Anthem) || 4</h3>
    <p>A rapper from the west side of Detroit, Michigan, Tyjuan Peoples goes by the name Zay Hilfigerrr. Prior to making an unexpected mainstream breakthrough in 2016, he was active on various social media platforms and increased his popularity by constantly uploading videos of his dancing, music, and skits. Local performances followed, as did the interest of film producer Timothy McCall, who contacted Peoples about being involved with the Detroit-based Fireworks Fireworks: The Movie. This led to Peoples meeting McCall's son James (aka Zayion), himself a fledgling rapper. The two eventually recorded "Juju on That Beat," a track with a production rooted in Crime Mob's 2004 single "Knuck If You Buck." Thanks to Fresh the Clowns, a dance group affiliated with Universoul Circus, the song became a viral hit as various dancers uploaded their own performances backed by the song. Major-label Atlantic gave the track an official release in September 2016 with "TZ Anthem" parenthetically added to the title. Within a couple weeks, the single reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi</p>
    <h3>Bruno Mars - 24K Magic || 3</h3>
    <p>Bruno Mars is among the flashiest, most versatile singer/songwriters in post-millennial pop. An all-around entertainer, he also plays multiple instruments, produces, and choreographs. His path to mainstream success was lengthy. After he worked a string of behind-the-scenes jobs, including writing songs for Brandy, singing backup for Sugababes, and impersonating Elvis Presley, he put his name on top of the Billboard Hot 100 by co-writing Flo Rida and Kesha's "Right Round." One year later, he collaborated with rapper B.o.B on "Nothin' on You" and co-wrote Travie McCoy's "Billionaire," both of which became Top Ten hits. Mars used that momentum to launch a solo career and became the first male vocalist in two decades to crack the Top Ten with his first four singles. 
Born Peter Hernandez in Honolulu, Hawaii, Mars kicked off his career at the age of four by fronting his uncle's band, becoming Oahu's youngest Elvis impersonator in the process. Ten years later, he was impersonating the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, as part of the Legends in Concert show. After graduating high school in 2003, he took his uncle's advice and moved to California to pursue a music career. He eventually met songwriter Phillip Lawrence, who convinced Mars to try his hand at writing songs for other artists. The two dubbed themselves the Smeezingtons and co-wrote Brandy's "Long Distance." The duo scored their first number one hit in 2009, when they co-authored Flo Rida's international smash "Right Round." 
By 2010, Mars seemed to be everywhere: singing alongside B.o.B on the chart-topping "Nothin' on You," co-writing "Billionaire," and collaborating with Cee-Lo Green on the Grammy-nominated hit "F*ck You!" He also began issuing his own material, starting with the May 2010 release of his first EP, It's Better If You Don't Understand. Doo-Wops & Hooligans, his full-length debut, appeared later that year and quickly produced a number one single, "Just the Way You Are." In 2012, Mars both hosted and performed as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live, debuting tracks from his upcoming album.
That album, the genre-jumping effort Unorthodox Jukebox, was released later in the year and featured the lead-off single "Locked Out of Heaven," along with production from Mark Ronson, Diplo, and others. "Locked Out of Heaven" topped the Hot 100, and the album reached number two in the U.S. The second single, "When I Was Your Man," also hit number one. All that success made Mars a natural for one of the world's most prestigious gigs, the half-time show for Super Bowl XLVIII, where he performed with Red Hot Chili Peppers. Unorthodox Jukebox later won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. 
The following year, Mars fronted Mark Ronson's "Uptown Funk," a song he co-wrote that was among the most popular singles of that year. It topped charts around the globe and took home several Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year. In 2016, Mars returned with another funk-flavored hit, "24K Magic," and its parent album of the same title. ~ David Jeffries & Andrew Leahey, Rovi</p>
    <h3>The Weeknd Ft. Daft Punk || 2</h3>
    <p>Evolving from French house pioneers in the '90s to 2000s tastemakers to mainstream successes in the 2010s, Daft Punk remained one of dance music's most influential and iconic acts.

After four long years of fans eagerly awaiting a follow-up to their brilliant debut, Daft Punk finally issued Discovery in March 2001. The live record Alive 1997 followed at the end of the year, and a by-now predictable four-year wait preceded the release of Human After All in early 2005.

    <h3 id="gold">Rae Sremmurd - Black Beatles || 1</h3>
    <p>California-born, Tupelo-raised, Atlanta-based rap duo Rae Sremmurd debuted on Mike WiLL Made It's late-2013 mixtape Mike Will Been Trill with "We," a scraping, lashing party track. While their name could have been read as a backward-spelled alias for Mike WiLL's songwriting and production syndicate EarDrummers, Rae Sremmurd turned out to be two young and exuberant rappers, Swae Lee (Khalif Brown) and Slim Jimmy (Aaquil Brown). They were former members of Dem Outta St8 Boyz, a trio that had competed on the Wild Out Wednesday segment of BET's 106 & Park program.
In February 2014, "We" was issued as Rae Sremmurd's first official single through Mike WiLL's Made-It Mafia label. Throughout the rest of 2014, following the signing of a contract with Interscope, the rowdy "No Flex Zone" and relatively kicked-back "No Type" and "Throw Sum Mo" (featuring Nicki Minaj and Young Thug) were released as preludes to the early-2015 album SremmLife. All three singles reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart. The first two received platinum certifications. In 2016, they returned with the single "By Chance," along with SremmLife 2, their sophomore LP. Later that year, they earned their first Billboard number one with "Black Beatles" featuring Gucci Mane. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi</p>
